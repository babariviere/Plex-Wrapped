# Plex Wrapped
A website and API for collecting Plex user stats within a set timeframe using Tautulli.

## Warning
I made this for fun, and I am currently working on perfecting it. All feedback and tips are welcome.

## Instructions
There are multiple settings you must configure! They are all located in <b>config.json</b>.
<br><br>
<b>Tautulli API key</b><br>
API key generated by Tautulli.

<b>Tautulli IP</b><br>
The IP address of the Tautulli server.

<b>config.json</b><br>
This file needs multiple values. Most importantly your Tautulli IP, port and API key. I made this using HTTP, if you use HTTPS you have to modify the API.

<b>Tautulli Port</b><br>
The port for the Tautulli server. Can be left as "".

<b>SSL</b><br>
This is supposed to enable HTTPS support, but it does not function at this time. Leave as false.

<b>Tautulli Root</b><br>
If using reverse proxy with a set root, add it here. Do not add "/" before or after.

<b>Library ID Movies</b><br>
The ID of your movie library in Tautulli. You can find it in the URL when visiting the library on the Tautulli website.

<b>Library ID Shows</b><br>
The ID of your show library in Tautulli. You can find it in the URL when visiting the library on the Tautulli website.

<b>Library ID Movies</b><br>
The id of your movie library in Tautulli. You can find it in the URL when visiting the library on the Tautulli website.

<b>Wrapped Start</b><br>
The beginning of the wrapped time period. Written in Epoch. Conversion can be done here https://www.epochconverter.com/.

<b>Wrapped End</b><br>
The end of the wrapped time period. Written in Epoch. Conversion can be done here https://www.epochconverter.com/.

<b>Get_... Settings</b><br>
Disables or enables different methods in the API. Will probably break the website without reconfiguration.

The number of items in your Tautulli database. Needed so API knows amount of data to load.
